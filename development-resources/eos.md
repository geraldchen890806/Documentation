# EOS

Guides, resources, and tools for developers building on EOS.

## **Official Resources**

Block.one, who build EOS, also provide plenty of documents.

* [EOS Official github](https://github.com/EOSIO)
* [EOS API Docs ](https://developers.eos.io/welcome/latest/reference/index)  RPC API，SDK API which support js、swift、java
* [EOS Deprecations ](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/7597) Table tracking significant deprecations in EOSIO software
* [Elemental Battles](https://battles.eos.io/)   Tutorial to build your first EOS blockchain game. 
* [EOS White Paper](https://github.com/EOSIO/Documentation/blob/master/TechnicalWhitePaper.md)
* [EOS StackExchange](https://eosio.stackexchange.com/)   StackExchange for EOS, developers from EOS may answer your questions
* [EOS Official Telegram Channel](https://t.me/joinchat/EaEnSUPktgfoI-XPfMYtcQ) 

## **Testnet**

* [EOS Official Testnet](https://testnet.eos.io/)  
* [Jungle Testnet](http://monitor.jungletestnet.io/#home)  The most famous testnet with beautiful monitor
* [Kylin Testnet](https://www.cryptokylin.io/)     Testnet launched by some Chinese technical nodes

## **EOS Wallet Protocol**

Major EOS wallets will be compatible with the following two protocols which are  essential for H5 Dapp developers:

* [Scatter](https://get-scatter.com/docs/getting-started)
* [SimpleWallet](https://github.com/southex/SimpleWallet/blob/master/README.md)

## EOS SDK <a id="getting-started"></a>

Below EOS SDKs are verified and workable:

* [EOSJS](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosjs)
* [GO](https://github.com/eoscanada/eos-go)
* [Java](https://github.com/TopiaCoin/EOSRPCAdapter-Java)
* [Python](https://github.com/eosnewyork/eospy)

## **EOS Blockchain Browser**

To query block transactions, a block browser is essential. Since the EOS mainnet was launched, until now, many excellent block browsers have emerged, and these top block browsers not only have their own characteristics, but have also withstood the impact of sudden increase in scale data from mining activities.

* [eosflare](https://eosflare.io/)  A browser with the highest availability, developed by a Chinese team.
* [eosq.app](https://eosq.app) Developed by Dfuse team, which provide **the most fine-grained** data.
* [bloks.io](https://bloks.io/)  Developed by EOSCafe and EOS HK. It's widely used and very easy to query data of smart contract.
* [eosx.io](https://eosx.io)   Developed by EOSAsia, it's like bloks.io; widely used in China. 
* [eosauthority](https://eosauthority.com/)  Developed by EOS Authority, their REX statistics are very useful.

## **EOS API Service**

Transaction push requires stable and reliable API services. Some highly stable API services are recommended below:

* [dfuse](https://www.dfuse.io/zh/%E4%B8%BB%E9%A1%B5)   Professional EOS and ETH API service providers who have obtained venture capital.  It is recommended to use if high reliability is needed.
* [eoscannon](https://mainnet.eoscannon.io)  Provide by EOS Cannon, stable and widely used.
* [greymass](https://eos.greymass.com)    Widely used. They're very technical, they provided history query alone for a long time.
* [eossweden](https://api.eossweden.se) Stable and widely used.
* [eosnewyork](https://api.eosnewyork.io)  

## **EOS Node Related**

To access EOS mainnet, you need to know the Endpoint information, and a snapshot is also needed to reduce the synchronization time:

* [Endpoint Peers](https://validate.eosnation.io/eos/reports/config.html)  Public P2P peers infomation provided by eosnation
* Snapshot download
  * [eossweden](http://snapshots.eossweden.org/)
  * [eosnation](https://snapshots.eosnation.io/)

## **The safety of node and smart contract**

Node and smart contract's security are very important. EOS DAPPs have been subjected to many attacks and different attack methods. Developers need to understand some security knowledge:
