# Introduction

Welcome to MYKEY developer center.

MYKEY is a self-sovereign identity system, which is the first implementation of KEY ID, to lower the threshold of public blockchains and DAPPs, work for mass adoption and be an important part of Web3.0 trust network.

As a multi-chain wallet, MYKEY, will support multiple smart contract platform. Since the MYKEY accounts saved in **smart contract** on each blockchain, MYKEY temporarily does not support blockchains without smart contract. Now MYKEY support **EOS** and **ETH**.

Here you can learn how to quickly integrate with the smart wallet - MYKEY, and get the most useful development resources. This website including:
