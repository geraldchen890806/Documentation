# KEY ID Ethereum DappLogic Contract Upgrade

According to the previous agreement, the upgrade of any KEY ID Ethereum contract will be carried out following Time-Lock mechanism and we will publish the upgrade reason and opensource contract code with 3rd-party audit report to the community in advance. New features need 4 days waiting period to be activated after the new contract is deployed and triggered. Users can supervise the upgrade during the period of the upgrade publicity and wait for activation.

**Reason for this upgrade**

Add the callMultiContract method for performing multiple operations atomically in a transaction.
